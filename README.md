- This project features the creation of AI agents for the Ghostbusters variant of Pacman, where the goal is to hunt invisible, moving ghosts in a strategic manner. It parallels the complexity found in real-world AI applications by requiring both static and dynamic decision-making in uncertain environments.

- Through the Ghostbusters project, I've showcased my ability to apply sophisticated machine learning techniques and algorithmic problem-solving skills, reflecting my readiness for tackling complex challenges in software engineering and AI domains.

## Core Functionalities
- **Sensing**: Agents use Bayesian inference to sense and locate invisible ghosts.
- **Tracking**: Implemented logic to track the movement of multiple ghosts over time.
- **Strategizing**: Developed strategies for efficient ghost capture, optimizing for both speed and accuracy.

## Implemented Features
- `bustersAgents.py`: Crafted intelligent agents capable of making real-time decisions in a stochastic game setting.
- `inference.py`: Applied probabilistic inference for dynamic tracking of ghost locations.
- `factorOperations.py`: Utilized operations to compute joint and marginalized probability distributions.

## Technologies & Skills
- **Python**: Extensive use of Python for all aspects of the project.
- **Probabilistic Models**: Employed Bayesian networks for inference under uncertainty.
- **Algorithm Design**: Designed and optimized algorithms to navigate and solve the Ghostbusters game efficiently.
